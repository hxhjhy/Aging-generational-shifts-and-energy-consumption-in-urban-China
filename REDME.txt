Summary:  We analysis the aging population and generation shifts will how to affect China's energy consumption duiring 2020-2050. We do so by applying detrended age-cohort-period
analysis to capture age and generation effects, and then apply multistate model for population projection. Based on the above parameters and input data, We calculated changes
 in energy consumption for the population over 60 years old duirng 2020-2050.


Data availability

In this paper, we use China Urban Household Survey data(CUHS) to perform age-cohort-period analysis. China Urban Household Survey data(CUHS) is an official
survey to  monitor the dynamic changes in the living standard of urban households. Due to security reasons, we have no right to public the dataset. But for academic
purposes,  researchers can apply for access to a  subset of the data at http://www.tcdc.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn. The data related to population projections are provided in the SI appendix.
