# Aging-generational-shifts-and-energy-consumption-in-urban-China

## Project Description

### Summary 

We analysis the aging population and generation shifts will how to affect China's energy consumption during 2020-2050. We do so by applying detrended age-cohort-period
analysis to capture age and generation effects, and then apply multistate model for population projection. Based on the above parameters and input data, We calculated changes in energy consumption for the population over 60 years old duirng 2020-2050.

### Data availability

In this paper, we use **China Urban Household Survey data(CUHS)** to perform age-cohort-period analysis. China Urban Household Survey data(CUHS) is an official micro survey launched by NBS to monitor the dynamic changes in the living standard of urban households. Due to security reasons, we have no right to public the dataset. But for academic purposes,researchers can apply  for access to the data at http://www.tcdc.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn. The data related to population projections are provided in the **SI appendix**. 

### Figures and model code

We use excel to draw almost all figures. The data for Figures are available in **Figure data.xlsx**. The code for pacd analysis and calculation for the firue data can be found in **pacd_lowess.do**. The population porjection used the model developed by International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA).
